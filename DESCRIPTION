Description: This package implements sufficient principal component regression.
    The name derives from the fact that "row-sparse" principal components 
    imply variable selection in PCR. Thus, we first implement an approximate 
    version of Fantope Projection and Selection (FPS, see documentation) before
    performing additional variable selection and regression.
