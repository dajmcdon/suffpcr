\title{Gene expression and patient clinical data for breast cancer}
\format{
A list with  named components:
\describe{
\item{x}{a named matrix with 253 rows and 11331 columns containing gene
expression data. Column names are
patient ids to match the clinical data while row names provide
information about the measured genes.}
\item{clinical}{data frame of clinical data for the patients (age,
survival status, lymph node involvement, age, subtype, etc.)}
