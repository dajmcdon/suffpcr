\title{Gene expression and survival data for breast cancer}
\format{
A list with 4 named components:
\describe{
\item{x}{gene expression measurements for 78 patients on 4751 genes}
\item{gene_info}{a character vector containing descriptions of the genes}
\item{survivial_time}{time in months before disease recurrence, possibly right
sensored}
\item{survival_status}{a zero/one indicator of whether the patient
had a "good" or "poor" prognosis based on whether or not disease
recurred within 5 years.
